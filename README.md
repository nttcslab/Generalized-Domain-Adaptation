# Generalized Domain Adaptation (CVPR2021)
This is the official PyTorch impelementation of our paper "Generalized Domain Adaptation" (CVPR2021).

This code provides an implementation of our domain adaptation method for problems where the domain label is completely unknown for all samples.

Our method comprises two major steps: 
1. Run domain estimation first to estimate the domain labels for all samples.
2. Run classifier learning next to learn a domain-invariant classifier using the estimated domain labels.

The codes and their details for each step are stored in a sub-directory with the corresponding name.

We use the dataset provided at https://github.com/zjy526223908/BTDA.

Please replace `<sub-directory>/data/<dataset>/imgs_dummy` with the respective `imgs` directory of https://github.com/zjy526223908/BTDA.
